 A scrapbooking application that I'm working on.

 The idea is to create something that can allow people to make scrapbooks online and then pdf some of them if they wish.
 
 The project is broken up into two parts: client and server.

 To run the project:
 ```
 cd client

 npm install
 ```

 In another terminal window
 ```
 cd server

 npm install
 ```

Then open the broswer at the address https://localhost:5173/
